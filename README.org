#+TITLE: Modred
Modern editor

* About
Modern is a Modern editor implemented in Forth.
It's a line editor.  I will try to maintain the compatibility with the
ED editor from the CP/M operating system by Digital Research.

* Features
  + Concurrent DOS keybindings 
  + Editing of multiple files
  + Will try to make it customizable and extensible using the FORTH
    programming language
