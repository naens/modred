#+TITLE: Modred
Modern editor

* About
Modern is a Modern editor implemented in Forth.
It's a line editor.  I will try to maintain the compatibility with the
ED editor from the CP/M operating system by Digital Research.

* Features
  + Concurrent DOS keybindings 
  + Multiple buffers: can correspond to different files, to different
    content copied, to drafts...
  + Editing of multiple files
  + Will try to make it customizable and extensible using the FORTH
    programming language

* Code Organization
There are two main modules which correspond to the two modes:
  + Insert mode: allows to input text directly into the buffer
  + Command mode: allows to execute commands on buffers
