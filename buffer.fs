\ ****h* modred/buffer
\ FUNCTION
\    The Buffer module contains words for the management of
\    Buffer objects.  That is the creation, destruction, data,
\    and cursor position.
\    The words are meant to be re-entrant.  It contains words
\    for creation and destruction, but no data is stored in the
\    module.
